**Progress report - Week 3 (08/05/23 - 12/05/23)**

Done:
- Change output format of existing availability functions (store results in new df columns and write to new file)
- Change way of handling polygons in existing availability functions
- Find function which transforms network provided by user to graph object
- Create availability function for greenspace coverage % within area of interest
- Update documentation of all availability functions

In progress:
- Integrating network file provided by user into workflow of creating isochrones
- First accessibility function - retrieving shortest network distance from house to park

Difficulties:
- Integrating network file provided by user into workflow of creating isochrones (minor difference between graph objects generated by momepy package and osmnx package seems to cause issues)
