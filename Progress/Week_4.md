**Progress report - Week 3 (15/05/23 - 19/05/23)**

Done:
- Include EPSG argument in all functions, if not specified and CRS of PoI file is geographic, CRS will be transformed to EPSG 3395 by default (and print warning)
- Divide greenspace coverage function into tree canopy coverage and park coverage functions
- Modify base accessibility function - retrieve park/network for total bounds of PoI, define park fake entry points and include destination argument 'centroids'/'entrance' (used a slightly different approach - elaborate Monday?)

In progress:
- Start looking into visibility

Difficulties:
- Integrating network file provided by user into workflow of functions (minor difference between graph objects generated by momepy package and osmnx package seems to cause issues) - ON HOLD, less priority
