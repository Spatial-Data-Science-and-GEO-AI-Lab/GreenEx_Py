**Progress report - Week 6 (29/05/23 - 02/06/23)**

Done:
- Change Viewshed GVI output as discussed
- Implement V1 of Streetview GVI based on Ilse's code
- Clean repository


Difficulties:
- Integrating network file provided by user into workflow of functions (minor difference between graph objects generated by momepy package and osmnx package seems to cause issues) - ON HOLD, less priority
- Streetview GVI code does not seem to run with multiprocessing on my laptop 
- Streetview GVI runs fine (without multiprocessing) in notebook (Streetview.ipynb), but raises warnings when importing visibility functions from .py file (as in example.ipynb)
- Change CRS of rasterio raster without writing to file (Viewshed GVI)
